# goEDMS
A golang/react EDMS for home users

EDMS stands for Electronic Document Management System.  Essentially this is used to scan and organize all of your documents.  OCR is used to extract the text from PDF's, Images, or other formats that we cannot natively get text from.

goEDMS is an EDMS server for home users to scan in receipts/documents and search all the text in them.  The main focus of goEDMS is simplicity (to setup and use) as well as speed and reliability.  Less importance is placed on having very advanced features.
